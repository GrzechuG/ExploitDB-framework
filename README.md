# ExploitDB-framework
This program is similiar in feel to metasploit-framework, but it 'uses' all exploits available on exploit-db.com.
You can search anything you want by simply typing 'use <exploit_path>' and your exploit gets downloaded from exploit-db and is ready to use. ExploitDB-framework will detect exploit type and pick the interpreter suitable (python , ruby, perl) and in case of .c files it automaticly compiles the exploit.
